Exersice 1,3 and 4 are about the procces of students making their way through the various school grounds to go to their respective classroom.
School areas include the yard->gym->stairs->floors where each floors has a number of classrooms, where each space has a limited amount of students that can be in it at the same time.
Thus aim is to showcase the "traffic" that will occur, and make sure all students reach their correct classrooms.
Difference of 3 and 4 to 1 is that after the students enter, we also simulate the arrival of the teacher in the classroom, locking any students from entering after that point,
and then simulating the school day by increasing the levels of fatigue for students and teachers.

Exersice 2 is about simulating the procces of students forming rows and going to a trip, where there is a case of a pair or group of students to be noisy and thus they need to be 
placed in a different class' queue, with an emphasis on placing students that made noise as a group in different classrooms.
